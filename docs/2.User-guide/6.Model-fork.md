# Model Fork
The model fork feature provides developers with a new way to customize models. By using the `Fork` operation, you can create a forked version based on an existing model and edit, manage, and train it. When a user selects an existing model to `Fork`, a new forked model is created, ensuring that all subsequent operations are independent of the original model, thus protecting the integrity and security of the original model.

## User Guide
1. In the training model interface, select the model and set the relevant parameters. Click the Fork button, enter the name of the forked model in the pop-up box. Click Create fork in the pop-up box to create the forked model.
