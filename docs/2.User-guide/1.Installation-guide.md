# Installation Guide

We recommend using Anaconda as the Python environment manager.
## Linux with Anaconda

1. Install Nvidia drivers, for details please refer to the [official documentation](https://www.nvidia.cn/drivers/lookup/). If you environment is CPU only, you can skip this step.

2. Install Anaconda. For detailed installation steps, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/).

    If you need to set up an Anaconda mirror, refer to [Anaconda Mirror Usage Help](https://mirrors.zju.edu.cn/docs/anaconda/).

3. Create a new conda environment and install Python and cuda-toolkit in the `ENVIRONMENT`:
    ```bash
    # For GPU
    conda create -n <ENVIRONMENT> -c nvidia -c pytorch python=3.9 cuda-nvcc=12.1 cuda-toolkit=12.1 cuda-compiler=12.1
    # For CPU, CPU do not support SpikeGPT and SpikingLlama
    conda create -n <ENVIRONMENT> -c pytorch python=3.9 pytorch torchvision cpuonly
    conda activate <ENVIRONMENT>
    ```

4. Install other dependencies:
    ```bash
    # Install cupy for accelerated computation
    conda install -c conda-forge cupy
    # Install ninja and gcc 12 for compilation
    # Environments based on CPU do not need to install ninja and gcc 12
    conda install -c conda-forge ninja gcc_linux-64=12
    ```

5. Install this package into the Python environment:
    There are two installation methods: using a whl file or installing from source.
    - Using a whl file:
        ```bash
        pip install DarwinKit-0.0.4-py3-none-any.whl
        ```
    - Installing from source:
        ```bash
        # Clone this repository to your local machine
        git clone http://10.39.15.252/leinao/DA-SPAIC.git
        cd DA-SPAIC
        pip install -e .
        # This will also automatically install dependencies listed in requirement.txt
        # If the installation is slow, you can use a mirror:
        # pip install -i https://mirrors.zju.edu.cn/pypi/web/simple -e .
        ```
        For setting up mirrors, refer to [Python Mirror Usage Help](https://mirrors.zju.edu.cn/docs/pypi/).
        > ⚠️ Since the current package is under development, you can install this repository into the Python environment using `pip install -e .` for convenience.

6. Install dependencies for SpikingLLama:
    You also need to install the flash attention's rotary embedding and fused entropy scripts. To install this module, run the following script:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention
    cd flash-attention
    cd csrc/rotary && pip install .
    cd ../xentropy && pip install .
    ```

## Possible Issues
1. If you encounter the error `Your compiler (c++) is not compatible with the compiler Pytorch was built with for this platform`.

    You need to install the corresponding compiler version used when PyTorch was compiled:
    ```bash
    # Install g++, according to your environment
    conda install -c conda-forge gxx_linux-64
    ```

2. If you encounter the error `RuntimeError: Error building extension 'wkv'` and see `nvcc: not found` or similar messages in the error details.

    This error may be due to the incorrect nvcc path. If CUDA is not installed, install CUDA. If CUDA is installed, add the CUDA path to the environment variables.

    ```bash
    # Temporarily modify environment variables
    ## Do not add bin at the end of the path, as it will cause duplicate bin folders
    export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-12.3
    ```

3. #error -- unsupported GNU version! gcc versions later than 13 are not supported! The nvcc flag '-allow-unsupported-compiler' can be used to override this version check; however, using an unsupported host compiler may cause compilation failure or incorrect run time execution. Use at your own risk.

    This error occurs because CUDA 11.4 does not support gcc versions higher than 13. You need to downgrade the gcc version. You can install gcc 13.3.0 using conda.
    ```bash
    conda install -c conda-forge gcc_linux-64=13.3.0
    # If there is a version mismatch, try the following command
    # conda install -c conda-forge gxx_linux-64=13.3.0 --override-channels -c conda-forge
    ```

4. fatal error: cuda_runtime.h: No such file or directory

    This error can be resolved as follows:
    ```shell
    # Find the path of the cuda_runtime.h file
    find folder -name "cuda_runtime.h"
    # Add the found path to the CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH environment variable
    export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH:/usr/local/cuda-12.3/include
    ```

5. If you encounter the error `UnicodeDecodeError: 'gbk' codec can't decode byte 0x84 in position 116: illegal multibyte sequence`,
    This error may be due to the open function in the read_version method in setup.py not matching the file encoding. Modify the open function to specify the correct encoding, such as utf-8:
    ```python
    def read_version():
        with open(os.path.join("darkit", "__init__.py"), encoding="utf-8") as f:
    ```

6. If you encounter the error `subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '['which', 'c++']' returned non-zero exit status 1.`,
    This error may be due to the lack of a C++ compiler. The solution is as follows:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install build-essential
    ```

7. If you choose to compile Graphviz from source and get error while installing `pip` package `nnviz`, probably the path of Graphviz installation is not specified. Please append the path to Graphviz installation in `C_INCLUDE_PATH`, `LD_FLAGS` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
    ```bash
    export C_INCLUDE_PATH=<graphviz_install_path>/include:$C_INCLUDE_PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<graphviz_install_path>/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    export LD_FLAGS="-L<graphviz_install_path>/lib"
    ```
