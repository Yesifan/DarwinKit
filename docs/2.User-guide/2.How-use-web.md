# WEB Tool

DarwinKit also provides a WEB tool to facilitate users to use DarwinKit more conveniently. The web tool is built into DarwinKit, and users can start the WEB service by running the `darkit start` command.

## Usage
After running the `darkit start` command, a WEB service will be started locally, and users can access the WEB tool through the browser at `http://localhost:8000`. After opening the webpage, you will see the following interface:

The web tool mainly provides the following functions:
1. Train models
2. Use trained models for prediction
3. View training logs and parameters of the models

By clicking the toolbox button in the top navigation bar of the webpage, you can enter the toolbox page and see the buttons for related functions.

### Train Models
Users can train models directly in the web tool. This tool has built-in models, data, and tokenizers. Users only need to select the corresponding model, data, and tokenizer on the webpage, and the hyperparameters of the model can also be set on the webpage, such as Learning Rate, Epochs, etc.

The training interface of the SpikeGPT model is as follows:

After setting the parameters of the model, click the `Train` button at the bottom right of the page to start training the model. The page will then jump to the training progress page, where users can view the progress information during the training process.

After the training is completed, the model will be saved (if the user chooses to save the model in the settings) to the DarwinKit model directory (default is `~/.cache/DarwinKit`, which can be modified by changing the `DSPIKE_HOME` environment variable). Then users can use the model for prediction on the prediction page or view the training logs and parameters of the model on the visualization page.

#### Resume Training
If users need to resume training based on the weights of a previously trained model, they only need to select the previously trained model in the `Resume` dropdown box on the training page, and then click the `Train` button to continue training from the last checkpoint.

### Predict Models
Users can use trained models for prediction. On the prediction page, users can select a trained model, then input text, and click the predict button to get the prediction result of the model.

All trained models will be displayed in the `Model Name` dropdown box, and users can select a model for prediction. The model prediction interface is shown below:
![model predict](/static/docs/predict.jpg)

After starting the prediction, the output of the model will be displayed on the page in real-time.

### Model Forking
The model forking feature provides developers with a new way to customize models. By using the `Fork` operation, you can create a forked version based on an existing model and edit, manage, and train it. Users select an existing model to `Fork`, creating a new forked model that ensures all subsequent operations are independent of the original model, protecting the integrity and security of the original model.

**User Guide**
1. On the train models page, select a model and set the relevant parameters. Click the Fork button, enter the name of the forked model in the pop-up box, and click Create fork in the pop-up box to create the forked model.

2. After creating the forked model, it will automatically jump to the model editing page. The introduction of the editing page is as follows.

3. After editing, click the fork in the sidebar to enter the management page of the forked model. In the Forked Model dropdown box, you can select the forked model. After selecting the model, you can click the `View & Edit` button to enter the editing page of the forked model, or click the `Train` button to train the model.

### Model Visualization
Users can view the training logs and parameters of trained models. On the visualization page, users can select trained models (multiple models can be selected for data comparison), and click the view button to see the visualized charts of the parameters.

The schematic diagram is as follows:

If the model is in training, the page will update the data in real-time.
